## Highlighted Projects

### 1. Spotify Top Songs Analysis (SQL)
- **Dataset**: Kaggle dataset (Top 50 Songs of 2021) and Hooktheory database
- **Description**:  
  In this project, I analyzed trends in the top 50 songs of 2021 using SQL. Using pitch-class integer notation, I examined the key and tonality of these songs. Additionally, I joined data from a Hooktheory database to compare the most popular song keys with those most represented in the top Spotify tracks of 2021.

### 2. Predictive Book Ratings Analysis (SQL)
- **Dataset**: Goodreads ratings and Booker Prize-winning books (2000–2021)
- **Description**:  
  This project examines how my personal book ratings differ from average Goodreads ratings. By categorizing books by genre, I obtained the average rating differences per genre. I also joined additional data on Booker Prize-winning books to predict how I might rate them, based on genre and my own rating patterns.
